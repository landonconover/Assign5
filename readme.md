# Assign 5
This is my Github project for Assignment 5, for my Javascript class.

I thought it would be cool to use Github for my project and use the git push and pull commands instead of FTP.

What I have done is set up my local directory to push to my Github repository, and then created a WebHook to run the git pull command to automatically update my website. In short, when I push to Github, my website automatically pulls from Github. Nifty!
